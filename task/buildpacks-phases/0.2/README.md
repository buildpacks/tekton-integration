# Buildpacks (phases)

This task builds source into a container image using [Cloud Native Buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io). To do that, it uses [builders](https://buildpacks.io/docs/concepts/components/builder/#what-is-a-builder) to run buildpacks against your application source.

> _**What are Cloud Native Buildpacks?**_
> 
> _Cloud Native Buildpacks are pluggable, modular tools that transform application source code into OCI images. They replace Dockerfiles in the app development lifecycle, and enable for swift rebasing of images and modular control over images (through the use of builders), among other benefits._

The lifecycle phases are run in separate containers to enable better security for untrusted builders. Specifically, registry credentials are hidden from the detect and build phases of the lifecycle, and the analyze, restore, and export phases (which require credentials) are run in the lifecycle image published by the [Cloud Native Buildpacks project]( https://hub.docker.com/u/buildpacksio).

See also [`buildpacks`](../../buildpacks) for the combined version of this task, which uses the [creator binary](https://github.com/buildpacks/spec/blob/platform/0.4/platform.md#operations), to run all of the [lifecycle phases](https://buildpacks.io/docs/concepts/components/lifecycle/#phases). This task, in contrast, runs all of the phases separately.

## Compatibility

- **Tekton** v0.17.0 and above
- **[Platform API][platform-api]** 0.4
    - For other versions, see [previous versions](#previous-versions).

## Install

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/buildpacks/tekton-integration/main/task/buildpacks-phases/0.2/buildpacks-phases.yaml
```

## Workspaces

 - **`source`**: Directory where application source is located. _(REQUIRED)_
 - **`cache`**: Directory where cache is stored (when no cache image is provided). _(optional)_

## Parameters

 - **`APP_IMAGE`**: The name of where to store the app image. _(REQUIRED)_
 - **`BUILDER_IMAGE`**: The image on which builds will run (must include lifecycle and compatible buildpacks). _(REQUIRED)_
 - **`SOURCE_SUBPATH`**: A subpath within the `source` input where the source to build is located. _(optional, default: "")_
 - **`ENV_VARS`**: Environment variables to set during _build-time_. _(optional, default: [])_
 - **`PROCESS_TYPE`**: The default process type to set on the image. _(optional, default: "web")_
 - **`RUN_IMAGE`**: Reference to a run image to use. _(optional, default: "")_
 - **`CACHE_IMAGE`**: The name of the persistent app cache image (if no cache workspace is provided). _(optional, default: "")_
 - **`USER_ID`**: The user ID of the builder image user. _(optional, default: "1000")_
 - **`GROUP_ID`**: The group ID of the builder image user. _(optional, default: "1000")_
 - **`PLATFORM_DIR`**: The name of the platform directory. _(optional, default: "empty-dir")_
 - **`LIFECYCLE_IMAGE`**: The image to use when executing sensitive phases. _(optional, default: "docker.io/buildpacksio/lifecycle:0.10.2@sha256:1bf8d3fc41d2fdf0ee4abdad50038ab8902ef58c74f5bcfc432c26767d889ed0")_
 - **`USER_HOME`**: Absolute path to the user's home directory. _(optional, default: "/tekton/home")_

## Builders

_The following are the suggested [builders][builders] from the [Cloud Native Buildpacks][buildpacks-io] project. This is only a subset of builders available._

 - **`gcr.io/buildpacks/builder:v1`**: Ubuntu 18 base image with buildpacks for .NET, Go, Java, Node.js, and Python

> Be sure to also supply a compatible builder image (`BUILDER_IMAGE` input) when running the task (i.e. one that has a lifecycle that supports the platform API).
